    title: "Why Wheel of Health Limited",
    content: `The Wheel of Health team of specialist Occupational and Physiotherapists 
    have gained significant experience culminating in a combined 150 years’ experience 
    of working within this specialism and the company strongly believe that the 
    assessment of and provision for clients with complex wheelchair seating needs and 
    postural analysis is critical to successful ongoing rehabilitative progress; as 
    such this will influence the longer-term prognosis for clients.`,
    content2: `Typically, Wheel of Health sees clients nationwide who have complex 
    needs including those with brain injuries (both acquired and at birth), spinal cord 
    injury, other catastrophic injury and other complex conditions and neurological 
    conditions.`,

      "Why might I need the input of Wheel of Health Limited for one of my clients?",
    content: `Wheel of Health is uniquely placed to carry out a detailed postural 
    analysis for your client and then to problem solve to the findings. Its team of 
    specialists are highly skilled and experienced within this specialism when 
    appointed and carry on being mentored and supervised so that their skill set 
    continues to improve and progress.`,
    content2: `As an organisation we are committed to the 
    long term; posture is never static but rather continues to evolve over time 
    and is dependent on many factors including the nature of the client’s diagnosis 
    and also on their rehabilitation and progress. We seek to be forward looking so 
    that equipment recommended and trialled is equipment which has a degree of 
    ‘future proofing’ if at all possible.`,
    content3: `Wheel of Health has, historically, only 
    worked with clients with complex needs so has gained, over the years, a specialism 
    in the needs of the clients that fall into that category. So, we are experienced 
    in working with clients and their advocates where clients present with challenging 
    behavioural issues as well as challenging physical issues.`,
    content4: `We understand how and 
    why a client has ended up presenting in the way that they have and have developed 
    skills to address that.`

    title: "What makes us different",
    content: `Wheel of Health Limited started out in 2005 (initially under another name) 
    and clinicians who work with us have extensive experience with working with clients 
    with specialist needs over a long period of time.`,
    content2: `We obviously have clinicians 
    who like to work with us as we have members on our team who have been with us for 
    many of those years! We meet for teaching and learning on a regular basis and have 
    an organisational structure that ensures that everyone within the team has access 
    to a mentor/ supervisor.`,
    content3: `So, all decisions are discussed prior to the consideration 
    of their implementation to ensure that we eliminate as many ‘gremlins’ as we can at 
    an early stage. Additionally, we work with a team of approved equipment supply partners 
    who are selected with care and formally commit to us, so we have confidence that they 
    also have a high level of skill and understanding of the complex clients that we 
    typically have referred to us.`,

    title:
      "If all of the above is true doesn’t that make Wheel of Health Limited much more expensive?",
    content: `We pride ourselves on being absolutely transparent about what our charges are 
    and how those charges are implemented. At the point of referral, you will be given costings 
    for an initial assessment and initial reporting on findings and recommendations.`,
    content2: `Thereafter 
    you will always be supplied with on-going ‘input estimate’ costings so that forward budgeting 
    can be realistically facilitated. A phone call or email to Wheel of Health headquarters is 
    all you need to do to kick start this process. And we are always happy to have informal 
    discussions with a potential referrer as to whether their client is one that we feel that 
    we could usefully help and support through this process.`,
