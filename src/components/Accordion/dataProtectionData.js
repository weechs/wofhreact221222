    title: "GDPR: Setting the scene",
    content: `The GDPR is applied to organisations that are either controllers of data 
    or those processing data. As in the current data protection act we are classed as 
    a controller. We are responsible for how and why personal data is processed and as 
    processors, our staff and associates are responsible to act on our behalf. However, 
    in the GDPR processors now have a specific legal obligation to maintain records on 
    what personal data they are processing and their processing activities. Therefore, 
    under GDPR both the controller and processor now have defined legal responsibilities.`,
    content2: `In the GDPR, personal data has been redefined and now covers a much wider 
    scope, including new areas such as IP addresses, CCTV and biometrics. The GDPR also 
    covers a ‘special’ category of personal data, referred to as sensitive data and may 
    only be processed within a limited number of circumstances.`,
    content3: `The principles that underpin the GDPR are ones that we would all hope 
    that people will carry out with our own data. From Article 5, personal data shall 
    be (paraphrased): 1) Processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner; 2)Collected 
    for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes; 3) Adequate, relevant and limited to 
    what is necessary; 4) Accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date; 5) Kept for no 
    longer than is necessary; 5) Processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security 
    of the personal data.`,
    content4: `Buried in these principles are some very important new requirements. For 
    example, Informed consent. The information on which we gain consent is informative, 
    unambiguous, and given freely. In addition, consent can be withdrawn. Data from 
    children (under 16) requires authorisation from a parent or guardian, and as a 
    controller and/or processor we make all reasonable efforts to obtain this.`

    title: "GDPR: An overview",
    content: `The Data Protection Act 1998. This was superseded by the General Data 
    Protection Regulation (GDPR) which came into force on 25th May, 2018.`,
    content2: `GDPR will apply to all organisations, no matter where they are based 
    and their size, if they offer goods or services (even if free) to individuals in 
    the EU. In addition, despite Brexit, the ICO have confirmed that they are likely 
    to implement similar rules after we have left the EU, to allow the United Kingdom 
    to operate on a level playing field with the continent. All organisations should 
    plan for, and be ready to comply with, the GDPR.`,
    content3: `The major changes are:
    1) Requirements for consent are more rigorous - The GDPR seeks to ensure that consent 
    is given and given freely, which means the subject must have a choice and isn’t forced 
    to give unnecessary details in the process of undertaking Wheel of Health business.Consent 
    must be informed and specific, with clarity on how to opt in and out, and about how the 
    data will be used; 2) Requirement to delete data at the subject’s request GDPR 
    implementation will bring with it the ‘right to be forgotten’ and the ‘right to object’. 
    All organisations must understand these rights and have processes in place to react to 
    subjects invoking their rights, including, but not limited to, removing their consent 
    and securely deleting their data; 3) Requirement to notify authorities within 72 hours 
    of any data breach. There will be a requirement of all organisations to report any 
    personal data breach to the relevant authorities and, in some cases, to the individuals 
    affected by the breach. The requirement to notify is for breaches that may result in a 
    risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals and this includes events that, for example, 
    may lead to financial loss, discrimination or loss of confidentiality; 4) Increased fines 
    for failure to comply`,

    title: "Data Protection",
    content: `Data Protection applies to all information we hold in computerised form 
    and also to non-computerised form, held in filing systems structured so that 
    specific information about particular individuals can be readily retrieved. Access 
    to records of deceased individuals still falls within the scope of the Access to 
    Health Records Act 1990.`,
    content2: `The Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) has specific responsibilities 
    for the promotion and enforcement of the DPA. Under the DPA, the Information Commissioner 
    (IC) may, (1) Serve information notices requiring data controllers to supply the ICO with 
    the information needed to assess compliance. (2) Where there has been a breach, serve an 
    enforcement notice which requires data controllers to take specified steps or to stop 
    taking steps in order to comply with the law.`,
    content3: `The Company Data Protection lead is Simon Weech, Director.
    Access to personal data is your right under the Data Protection Act. Any request for access 
    to data must be made in writing to:

    title: "GDPR: The regulation",
    content: `The GDPR is a European-wide regulation that came into force on 25 May 2018. The 
    legislation is designed to protect people’s personal data from being stolen or exploited 
    by companies. Central to the new regulation is the idea of keeping people’s personal data 
    safe and accurate, obtaining consent to collect it, and having a business purpose to hold 
    on to it. Current data-protection legislation goes some way towards this, but the GDPR 
    goes further.`,
    content2: `What is personal data? - Personal data is any information that can be used to 
    identify an individual, such as name, postal address, email address, date of birth, gender, 
    National Insurance number, NHS number, bank details, credit card details and so on. Often 
    it is information that will be collected as part of marketing activity or held about 
    customers that you’ve worked with. Some personal data is classified as sensitive and 
    requires particularly careful handling. This includes data on an individual’s ethnicity, 
    religion, political affiliation, sexual orientation, trade union membership, previous 
    criminal convictions, biometric data (such as fingerprints or eye scans), physical or 
    mental health.`,
    content3: `The GDPR broadens out the definition of personal data from the existing Data 
    Protection Act. It now includes almost any information that can be used to identify an 
    individual when combined with other elements of personal data. For example, items such 
    as IP addresses (for individual computers) or physical records, such as business cards, 
    record cards and manual filing systems, can now be classed as personal data. Also, 
    businesses that use fingerprint recognition to gain access to a building or a locker 
    (as in a gym) will also be subject to the regulations.`,
    content4: `Many of your individual rights are similar to the Data Protection Act. People 
    have the right to request access to any personal data you hold on them, under a subject 
    access request. Under the GDPR we provide this free of charge, if it is a ‘reasonable’ 
    request i.e. not one that has been made repeatedly and not for volumes of information 
    that it would be impossible to produce within the time allowed. The deadline for us to 
    provide the information has also been reduced to 30 days. You have the right to object 
    to how we use your data. If we process data for direct marketing, we will stop using your 
    data as soon as you receive an objection, until either the objection is resolved, or your 
    data is removed.`

    title: "GDPR: Our Data Retention",
    content: `A data retention policy is a requirement of the GDPR. If you wish to know more 
    information on how long we retain data please get in touch with us.`,
    content2: `Right To Withold Personal Data - Under the GDPR, Wheel of Health Limited can 
    withhold personal data if disclosing it would ‘adversely affect the rights and freedoms 
    of others. We will take any necessary legal advice if we are proposing to withhold 
    information on this basis, as Wheel of Health Limited will need to carefully consider 
    its applicability and its use which should not act to result in a refusal to provide 
    all information.`,
    content3: `How should the information be given to the applicant - Any person making a 
    subject access request (SAR) only has the right to see their own personal data, rather 
    than a right to see copies of the documents that contain their personal data. Often, 
    the easiest way to provide the relevant information is for us to supply copies of 
    original documents, but we are not obliged to do this. Once the personal data that 
    is relevant to the request has been located and retrieved, we will communicate the 
    data in an intelligible form.`,

    title: "GDPR: Our Consent",
    content: `The End of Passive Consent - One of the most significant impacts of the GDPR 
    is the strengthened requirement for getting consent to hold and process your data. 
    Previously, consent was defined as any freely given specific and informed indication 
    of their wishes. In practice companies often relied upon the person’s failure to opt 
    out as evidence of his consent.`,
    content2: `As a Data Controller we must now capture each consent, together with the 
    version of the privacy notice that accompanied the consent, and hold it on file. 
    If only partial consent is given, the system must be capable of screening out any 
    unauthorised use.`,
    content3: `Consent must be capable of being withdrawn at any time.`,
    content4: `The GDPR adds two further requirements with consent; transparency and 
    internal documentation. This is informed at the time of the purpose for which the 
    data is collected and the legitimate interest which it pertains. This is embodied in 
    our privacy notice.`

    title: "GDPR: Subject Access Requests",
    content: `What is a SAR?
    A SAR is a request for personal information that the company may hold about a data 
    subject i.e. an individual. If an individual wishes to exercise their subject access 
    right, the request must be made in writing. The purpose of a SAR is to make individuals 
    aware of and allow them to verify the lawfulness of processing of their personal data. 
    Under the GDPR and the current Data Protection Act (DPA), individuals have the right 
    to obtain confirmation as to whether personal data about them is being processed by 
    the company. `,
    content2: `Key Changes to SARs under GDPR - Under the GDPR, the procedure for making a 
    SAR is similar to the procedure under the DPA. However, there are some key changes to 
    be aware of which; 1) Fees: Under the DPA, Wheel of Health can charge up to £10 for a SAR. 
    Under the GDPR, a request for personal information is free unless the request is 
    ‘manifestly unfounded or excessive.’ Wheel of Health can charge a ‘reasonable fee’ 
    for multiple requests; 2) Response time: Under the DPA, we must respond to SARs within 
    40 days of receipt of the written request. Under the GDPR, we must respond to SARs 
    within one month of receipt. This deadline can be extended by a further two months 
    where there are a number of requests or the request is complex but we must contact 
    the individual within a month of receipt, explaining why the extension is necessary.`,
    content3: `Provision of Information - Individuals can make a SAR electronically. 
    If they do so, the information provided should be in a commonly-used electronic format, 
    unless otherwise requested. But remember Wheel of Health verify the individual’s 
    identity prior to granting access to information. This can sometimes take a little 
    time especially if it is a guardian or someone acting under a power of attorney who 
    are seeking the information about a data subject.`,
    content4: `In responding to a subject access request, Wheel of Health Limited will need 
    to advise you,the data subject of: 1) The purposes of the processing; 2) The categories 
    of personal data concerned; 3) Who are the recipients to whom we disclose the information; 4)
    Where possible, how long we will hold onto the information or what categories have been 
    used to decide how long the personal information will be held for; 5) The right to 
    request rectification, erasure or restriction of the processing; 6) The right to lodge 
    a complaint to the ICO; 7) The source from where Wheel of Health Limited  obtained the data.
    and finally, 8) The existence of any automated decision-making.`
